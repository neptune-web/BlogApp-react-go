# Blog App with React, Go, and SQL

Blog app using ReactJS as the frontend, Go as the backend, and MySQL as the database. This is also the first web application project where I have implemented Go and MySQL. Users can register, login, post an article, edit and delete articles, like other articles, and delete their accounts.

To run the app, simply clone the repo and start the servers in App.js (npm start) and Go (go run main.go). Also make sure your SQL server is running.
